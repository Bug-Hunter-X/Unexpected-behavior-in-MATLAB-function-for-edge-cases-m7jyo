This repository contains a MATLAB function with a subtle bug related to edge case handling. The function `myFunction` calculates a result based on the input `x`, but its behavior is not clearly defined when `x` is exactly 0 or 10.  The `bug.m` file demonstrates this issue and `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected implementation. The problem involves the lack of explicit handling of the boundary values in the if-elseif-else construct, leading to unexpected outputs.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to these edge cases, ensuring consistent and predictable function behavior.
